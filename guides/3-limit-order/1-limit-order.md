1. **Input:** Pick a token from the selector drop-down and specify the amount of tokens that you want to limit sell.
2. **Rate/ Price:** Here you specify the limit order rate / price that you're buying the output token (Or `Use Market` for the current market price).
3. **Expiry:** Set an expiry period for your order, from 10 minutes to custom, or even never.
4. **Output:** Jupiter Limit Order will be able to compute your parameters and come up with the rate that you'll be getting.
5. **Place Order:** Once you've reviewed the order details, you will be able to place the limit order and submit the transaction to the system.

### Open Order

The Open Orders section is where users will see their open submitted orders that are in the system and have yet to be filled.

1. **Order Info:** This identifies the order token details from TokenA _(Selling)_ to TokenB _(Buying)_ and the amounts for the order.
2. **Price:** Price is the specified user submitted rate for the limit order - When the on-chain price of the purchase token hits, order will be executed, if there is liquidity available.
3. **Expiry:** This is the time dimension set by user when submitting the order, which can be helpful to auto-cancel orders after a specific time period. In this example it's `Never`, therefore the order will remain active on-chain until the price hits the specified amount, at which point the order will be executed.
4. **Filled Size:** The fulfillment indicator to monitor the size of the order which has been filled. If it is a large order, and there is insufficient liquidity on-chain, Jupiter's keeper will try to execute partially, and continue monitoring on-chain price to fulfill the rest of the order. If the order is fully executed, Jupiter will send the tokens directly to user's wallet. There is no claiming process required once a Limit Order is entirely filled.
5. **Action:** Action is where users are able to cancel and close their order/positions.

### Order History

![Limit Order 3](../img/limit-order/limit-order-3.png)

Order History section is where users keep track of orders that have been completed or cancelled.

1. **Price:** Price is the specified user submitted rate for the limit order - When the on-chain price of the purchase token hits, order will be executed, if there is liquidity available.
2. **Limit Price:** Limit Price is the single unit price for the order - X amount of TokenA per TokenB.
3. **Expiry:** This is the time dimension set by user when submitting the order, which can be helpful to auto-cancel orders after a specific time period. 
4. **Filled Size:** Filled size shows how much of total order size has been fulfilled.
5. **Status:** Status indicates the order state - Completed / Cancelled.
6. **Action - Cancel:** This order was cancelled. Upon cancelling an order the users funds are refunded back to their wallet.
7. **Action - Trade:** This is the actual trade transaction being executed when the on-chain price hits the specified price submitted by user. These trade actions can occur several times for each created order, depending on the available liquidity in the market.
8. **Action - Create:** This is the creation of the order, where the user specified the limit order details and deposited the funds for the order to be created.
